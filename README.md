# Real-Time Background Replacement with OpenCV & MediaPipe

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time background replacement using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**. It utilizes MediaPipe's Selfie Segmentation model to separate the foreground (person) from the background, allowing for dynamic background replacement with a custom image.

## Key Features
- Real-time background replacement in webcam feed.
- Uses **MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation** for accurate foreground detection.
- Allows easy background customization by replacing the default background with any image.
- Simple and intuitive code structure for easy understanding.
- Comprehensive documentation is provided to explain the working of the project.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
